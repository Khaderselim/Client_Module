# Introduction

This project introduces a semi-automated PrestaShop module designed for e-commerce users to monitor and extract data from competitors‚Äô product listings. The module allows users to select products from their catalog and input URLs of similar products offered by competitors. 

Once configured, the module automatically retrieves key information from the specified URLs ‚Äî including product title, price, description, and stock status ‚Äî providing valuable insights for pricing and inventory strategies. 

Data extraction is powered by a Python-based API running in a Dockerized server environment, ensuring scalability, portability, and ease of deployment. This integration empowers PrestaShop users to enhance their competitive intelligence and stay agile in a rapidly evolving market.

# Getting Started

## Overview

Our goal with this project is to make product tracking simple and effortless. This guide will walk you through everything you need to get started with the module ‚Äî from setting up your Docker server and installing the PrestaShop module to tracking your first competitor products. With just a few steps, you'll be able to monitor and extract valuable data from your competitors' listings with ease.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python** (3.12)
- **PHP** (8.0)
- **PrestaShop** (1.7 or higher)
- **Docker**

---

# Installation

## üê≥ 1. API Setup with Docker

For a smooth and quick installation, we recommend running the API using **Docker**.

### Steps

1. **Download the `server` folder** from the repository:
    - [Insert your repo link or specific download instructions here]

2. **Open a terminal** in the project folder (where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located), then run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. The API will start and be accessible at:

    ```
    http://localhost:8000
    ```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Port Customization

If port `8000` is already in use or you want to change it, open the `docker-compose.yml` file and update the following line:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8000:8000"  # Change HOST_PORT to any port you prefer (e.g., 8080:8000)
```

After making changes, restart the container:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

---

### üîÅ Restarting & Stopping

- **Stop the API**: Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
- **Restart the API**: Run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

---

### üê≥ Optional: Use Docker Desktop

If you prefer a GUI, you can use **Docker Desktop** to:

- Start/Stop containers
- View logs
- Monitor ports and resource usage

---

## üß© 2. Module Installation in PrestaShop

### Step 1: Download the Module

- Download the `client` folder from the repository:
    - [Insert your repository link here]

---

### Step 2: Move the Module to PrestaShop

- Move the `client` folder into the `modules/` directory of your PrestaShop installation.

**Example**: If using **Laragon**, the path might look like:

```
C:/laragon/www/prestashop/modules
```

---

### Step 3: Access PrestaShop Admin Panel

1. Open your PrestaShop admin panel in a browser. If running locally, it may look like:

    ```
    http://localhost/prestashop/admin
    ```

2. If it doesn't open:
    - Ensure your **local server** (like Laragon or XAMPP) is running.
    - Check the admin folder name ‚Äî PrestaShop sometimes renames it (e.g., `admin123xyz`). You can rename it back to `admin` or find the correct folder name inside your PrestaShop directory.

---

### Step 4: Install the Module

1. In the PrestaShop back office, navigate to:

    ```
    Modules ‚Üí Module Manager ‚Üí Uninstalled Modules
    ```

2. Find the **Product Tracking** module.
3. Click **Install**.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è 3. Insert Your Product Table in the Database

### Step 1: Connect to the PrestaShop Database

Use one of the following tools to connect:

- **phpMyAdmin** (typically included with Laragon/XAMPP)
- **MySQL Workbench**
- **Database tools in your IDE** (e.g., VS Code, PhpStorm, etc.)

---

### Step 2: Insert Your Product Table

Create and insert your custom product table into the PrestaShop database. Name the table appropriately (e.g., `my_products`) and keep track of the name for future steps.

---

### Step 3: Modify the Module to Use Your Table

Edit the following file:

```
prestashop/modules/client/controllers/admin/AdminClientproductsController.php
```

#### A. Update `processAdd()` Method

- **Line 316**: Update the table name:

    ```php
    $db_product = Db::getInstance()->getRow("SELECT * FROM " . _DB_PREFIX_ . "your_product_table WHERE name = '" . pSQL($main_product->name) . "'");
    ```

- **Lines 364‚Äì367**: Update keys to match your table‚Äôs columns:

    ```php
    $main_product->name = $db_product['name'];
    $main_product->url = $db_product['url'];
    $main_product->price = $db_product['price'];
    $main_product->description = $db_product['description']; // Optional
    ```

---

#### B. Update `processUpdate()` Method

- **Line 525**: Update the table name:

    ```php
    $db_product = Db::getInstance()->getRow("SELECT * FROM " . _DB_PREFIX_ . "your_product_table WHERE name = '" . pSQL($main_product->name) . "'");
    ```

- **Lines 526‚Äì528**: Update the column keys:

    ```php
    $main_product->url = $db_product['url'];
    $main_product->price = $db_product['price'];
    $main_product->description = $db_product['description']; // Optional
    ```

---

#### C. Update `ajaxProcessSearchTargetProducts()` Method

Replace `"target_product"` with your custom table name and update fields (`url`, `name`, `price`, etc.):

```php
$products = Db::getInstance()->executeS('
    SELECT *
    FROM `' . _DB_PREFIX_ . 'your_product_table`
    WHERE name LIKE "%' . pSQL($query) . '%"
    LIMIT 10
');

foreach ($products as $product) {
    $html .= '<li class="search-item" data-url="' . htmlspecialchars($product['url']) . '">' .
        '<span class="product-name">' . htmlspecialchars($product['name']) . '</span>' .
        '<small class="text-muted"><strong>URL: </strong>' . htmlspecialchars($product['url']) . '</small><br>' .
        '<small class="text-muted"><strong>Price: </strong>' . htmlspecialchars($product['price']) . '</small>' .
        '</li>';
}
```
